It seems like you want to modify the query to achieve two main goals:

1. Retrieve only one `PRODUCT_QTY` for each unique `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` per `BATCH_NO`.
2. Summarize the results by displaying each `BATCH_NO` along with `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`, one selected `PRODUCT_QTY`, and the total sum of `PRODUCT_QTY` for `PROD_TYPE = 'JUMBO'`.

Here’s how you can approach this:

### Step 1: Adjust the Query to Retrieve One `PRODUCT_QTY` per `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`

To achieve this, you can use the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to select only one row per `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` within each `BATCH_NO`. Here’s how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    'JUMBO' AS PROD_TYPE,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    PRODUCT_QTY,
    INPUT_QTY
FROM (
    SELECT
        A.ORGANIZATION_ID,
        A.TRX_DATE,
        A.BATCH_NO,
        A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
        B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
        A.PRODUCT_QTY,
        B.INPUT_QTY,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A.BATCH_NO, A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE ORDER BY A.TRX_DATE) AS rn
    FROM (
        -- Subquery A for PRODUCT_QTY
        SELECT
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE AS PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
            SUM(TRX_QTY) AS PRODUCT_QTY
        FROM
            XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE
            LINE_TYPE = 1
            AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%J%'
            AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID
            AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE
        GROUP BY
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE
    ) A
    JOIN (
        -- Subquery B for INPUT_QTY
        SELECT
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE AS INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
            SUM(TRX_QTY) AS INPUT_QTY
        FROM
            XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE
            LINE_TYPE = -1
            AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%J%'
            AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID
            AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE
        GROUP BY
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE
    ) B ON A.BATCH_NO = B.BATCH_NO AND A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.ITEM_CODE
) C
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO;
```

### Step 2: Summarize the Results

To get the summarized total `PRODUCT_QTY` for each `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`, you can further wrap the above query in an outer query that groups by `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` and computes the total sum:

```sql
SELECT
    BATCH_NO,
    PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    PRODUCT_QTY,
    SUM(PRODUCT_QTY) OVER () AS TOTAL_SUM
FROM (
    -- Previous query with modifications
) D
GROUP BY
    BATCH_NO,
    PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    PRODUCT_QTY
ORDER BY
    BATCH_NO;
```

This final query will give you the desired output with one `PRODUCT_QTY` per `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` per `BATCH_NO` and a total sum of `PRODUCT_QTY` across all `BATCH_NO`.

Make sure to replace `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` with your actual table name and adjust the placeholders `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` with your variables or values accordingly. Adjust column names (`ITEM_CODE`, `TRX_QTY`, etc.) as per your actual schema.
