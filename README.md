To troubleshoot why your full query isn't returning any data despite the inner queries working fine, you can check the following cases. These cases will help you systematically debug and identify potential issues with your SQL query and data:

### Case 1: Verify Parameter Values
Ensure that the parameters `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` have valid values that match existing data in your `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` table.

Example:
- `:ORGANIZATION_ID` should be a valid organization ID that exists in your data.
- `:TRX_DATE` should be a date for which there are transactions in your database.

### Case 2: Check INNER Queries Separately
Run each inner query separately with hardcoded values for `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` to verify they return expected results.

Example for Subquery A (PRODUCT_QTY):
```sql
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE AS PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    SUM(TRX_QTY) AS PRODUCT_QTY
FROM
    XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE
    LINE_TYPE = 1
    AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
    AND ORGANIZATION_ID = 1036  -- Replace with actual value
    AND TRX_DATE = TO_DATE('31-Mar-24', 'DD-Mon-YY')  -- Replace with actual value
GROUP BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE;
```

Example for Subquery B (INPUT_QTY):
```sql
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE AS INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    SUM(TRX_QTY) AS INPUT_QTY
FROM
    XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE
    LINE_TYPE = -1
    AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
    AND ORGANIZATION_ID = 1036  -- Replace with actual value
    AND TRX_DATE = TO_DATE('31-Mar-24', 'DD-Mon-YY')  -- Replace with actual value
GROUP BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE;
```

Ensure these queries return rows of data. If they don't return any rows, then there might be no data in your table that matches the specified criteria.

### Case 3: Verify Join Conditions
Check if the join condition `A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE` correctly links the rows between the two subqueries. 

Example:
- Ensure that `INPUT_ITEM_CODE` in subquery `B` corresponds to `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` in subquery `A` as per your data model.

### Case 4: Review Filtering Conditions
Review the filtering conditions `LINE_TYPE = 1`, `LINE_TYPE = -1`, and `PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'` to ensure they accurately filter the data as expected.

Example:
- Verify if there are transactions with `LINE_TYPE` 1 and -1 for `PROD_TYPE` matching 'JUMBO'.

### Case 5: Validate Data Existence
Double-check if there are actual rows in your `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` table that satisfy the combined conditions of `LINE_TYPE`, `PROD_TYPE`, `ORGANIZATION_ID`, and `TRX_DATE`.

### Case 6: Debugging with Limited Rows
To simplify debugging, you can limit the number of rows returned by adding `ROWNUM <= 10` (or equivalent based on your database) at the end of each inner query to check for a small subset of data.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    -- Your inner query here
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

This will help you verify if the issue is related to the amount of data being processed or if it persists even with a limited dataset.

### Case 7: Check Permissions and Schema
Ensure that the user executing the query has the necessary permissions to access the `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` table and perform the operations (SELECT, GROUP BY, etc.) required by your query.

### Case 8: Execute Full Query with Known Data
Once you've verified each of the above cases and ensured that your inner queries are returning expected results, execute the full query with known data values for `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` that you have previously validated.

By systematically checking these cases, you should be able to identify where the issue lies and resolve why your full query isn't returning the expected data. Adjustments may be needed based on the specifics of your database schema and the actual data available.
