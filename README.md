### Explanation:

1. **Main Query**: This query retrieves data for `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `PROD_TYPE` as `'JUMBO'`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`, `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`, `PRODUCT_QTY`, and `INPUT_QTY`.

2. **Subquery A**: Retrieves `PRODUCT_QTY` from `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` where `LINE_TYPE = 1` and `PROD_TYPE` matches `'JUMBO'`. It sums up `TRX_QTY` grouped by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, and `ITEM_CODE`.

3. **Subquery B**: Retrieves `INPUT_QTY` from the same table where `LINE_TYPE = -1` and `PROD_TYPE` matches `'JUMBO'`. It also sums up `TRX_QTY` grouped by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, and `ITEM_CODE`.

4. **JOIN**: Joins subqueries `A` and `B` on `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = INPUT_ITEM_CODE` to ensure that `INPUT_QTY` corresponds to the correct `PRODUCT_QTY`.

5. **ROW_NUMBER()**: Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` window function partitioned by `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`, ordered by `TRX_DATE`. This ensures that only one row (`rn = 1`) per `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` combination is selected, avoiding duplicates.

6. **Outer Query**: Selects columns from the joined and filtered result (`C`), ensuring that only the rows where `rn = 1` are returned.

7. **ORDER BY**: Orders the final result by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, and `BATCH_NO` as per your requirement.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` with actual values or variables in your application code. Adjust column names (`XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS`, `TRX_QTY`, etc.) according to your database schema. This query should now work correctly to fetch the desired data as per your specifications.
