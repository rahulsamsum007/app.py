In Case 3, we need to verify that the join condition `A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE` is correctly linking the rows between the two subqueries (`A` and `B`). Hereâ€™s how you can implement and verify this join condition in your SQL query:

### Example Code for Case 3:

Assuming you have already validated the inner queries (`A` for `PRODUCT_QTY` and `B` for `INPUT_QTY`), we focus on ensuring the join condition is correctly implemented.

```sql
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    'JUMBO' AS PROD_TYPE,
    TRX_DATE,
    A.BATCH_NO,
    A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    A.PRODUCT_QTY,
    B.INPUT_QTY
FROM (
    SELECT
        A.ORGANIZATION_ID,
        A.TRX_DATE,
        A.BATCH_NO,
        A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
        B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
        A.PRODUCT_QTY,
        B.INPUT_QTY,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A.BATCH_NO, A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE ORDER BY A.TRX_DATE) AS rn
    FROM (
        -- Subquery A for PRODUCT_QTY
        SELECT
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE AS PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
            SUM(TRX_QTY) AS PRODUCT_QTY
        FROM
            XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE
            LINE_TYPE = 1
            AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
            AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID
            AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE
        GROUP BY
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE
    ) A
    JOIN (
        -- Subquery B for INPUT_QTY
        SELECT
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE AS INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
            SUM(TRX_QTY) AS INPUT_QTY
        FROM
            XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE
            LINE_TYPE = -1
            AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
            AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID
            AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE
        GROUP BY
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE
    ) B ON A.BATCH_NO = B.BATCH_NO AND A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE  -- Join condition
) C
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    A.BATCH_NO;
```

### Explanation:

- **Subquery `A`**: Calculates `PRODUCT_QTY` grouped by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`.

- **Subquery `B`**: Calculates `INPUT_QTY` grouped by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`.

- **Join Condition (`ON` Clause)**: Ensures that `A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` matches `B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE` and `A.BATCH_NO` matches `B.BATCH_NO`. This links the `PRODUCT_QTY` with the corresponding `INPUT_QTY` for each `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`.

- **Outer Query (`C`)**: Selects columns from the joined result (`A` and `B` joined on `BATCH_NO` and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`) where `rn = 1` to fetch only one row per `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` combination.

- **Ordering**: Orders the final result by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, and `A.BATCH_NO` as specified.

### Steps to Verify Case 3:

1. **Check Join Results**: Execute the query and inspect the results to verify that `PRODUCT_QTY` and `INPUT_QTY` are correctly linked based on `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`.

2. **Debug with SELECT Statements**: Use `SELECT` statements with hardcoded values for `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` in each inner query (`A` and `B`) to ensure they return expected results separately.

3. **Review Data Relationships**: Cross-check the relationships between `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` in subquery `A` and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE` in subquery `B` to confirm they correctly correspond to each other.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the join condition (`A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE`) is correctly implemented and that your SQL query effectively retrieves the desired data with proper linkage between `PRODUCT_QTY` and `INPUT_QTY` based on your business logic. Adjust the query as per your specific database schema and requirements.
