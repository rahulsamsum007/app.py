To include the `RM_CUR_VALUE` in the provided query, we need to ensure the calculations align with the previous query's logic. We will include the necessary joins and subqueries to compute `RM_CUR_VALUE` appropriately.

Hereâ€™s the revised query with `RM_CUR_VALUE` added:

### Key Points:
1. **Subquery for `RM_CUR_VALUE` Calculation**:
   - This subquery computes `RM_CUR_VALUE` using similar logic to your previous query, including necessary joins with cost-related tables.

2. **Joins**:
   - The main query joins `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, and the new subquery `RM_CUR` to include the calculated `RM_CUR_VALUE`.

3. **Grouping and Summarizing**:
   - The query ensures data is grouped and summarized properly to provide accurate results for `INPUT_QTY`, `OUTPUT_QTY`, and `RM_CUR_VALUE`.

This structure keeps the original logic intact while incorporating the additional calculation for `RM_CUR_VALUE`. Ensure you replace `:P_ORGANIZATION_ID`, `:P_TRX_DATE`, `:P_ORG_ID`, and `:P_DATE` with appropriate values or parameters as needed.
