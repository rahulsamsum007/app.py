It seems like there are several issues with the provided code. Here's a corrected version:

In this corrected version, I've made sure to properly loop through the `ZONE_CUR` cursor using `ZONE_REC` as the loop variable. Inside this loop, the `SEG` cursor is iterated using `ZONE_REC.ZONE` as the parameter. Additionally, I've included placeholders for HTML content that you might want to add within the loops.
