I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems there was a misunderstanding in how the columns are referenced after the join in the outer query. Let's correct this by ensuring that all columns referenced in the outer query are properly aliased from the inner queries (`A` and `B`). 

Here's how you can revise the query to correctly reference the `BATCH_NO` column after the join:

```sql
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    'JUMBO' AS PROD_TYPE,
    TRX_DATE,
    A.BATCH_NO,
    A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    A.PRODUCT_QTY,
    B.INPUT_QTY
FROM (
    SELECT
        A.ORGANIZATION_ID,
        A.TRX_DATE,
        A.BATCH_NO,
        A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
        B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
        A.PRODUCT_QTY,
        B.INPUT_QTY,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A.BATCH_NO, A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE ORDER BY A.TRX_DATE) AS rn
    FROM (
        -- Subquery A for PRODUCT_QTY
        SELECT
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE AS PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
            SUM(TRX_QTY) AS PRODUCT_QTY
        FROM
            XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE
            LINE_TYPE = 1
            AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
            AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID
            AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE
        GROUP BY
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE
    ) A
    JOIN (
        -- Subquery B for INPUT_QTY
        SELECT
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE AS INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
            SUM(TRX_QTY) AS INPUT_QTY
        FROM
            XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE
            LINE_TYPE = -1
            AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
            AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID
            AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE
        GROUP BY
            ORGANIZATION_ID,
            TRX_DATE,
            BATCH_NO,
            ITEM_CODE
    ) B ON A.BATCH_NO = B.BATCH_NO AND A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE  -- Join condition
) C
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    A.BATCH_NO;
```

### Explanation:

- **Subquery `A`**: Calculates `PRODUCT_QTY` grouped by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`.

- **Subquery `B`**: Calculates `INPUT_QTY` grouped by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, `BATCH_NO`, and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`.

- **Join Condition (`ON` Clause)**: Ensures that `A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` matches `B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE` and `A.BATCH_NO` matches `B.BATCH_NO`. This links the `PRODUCT_QTY` with the corresponding `INPUT_QTY` for each `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE`.

- **Outer Query (`C`)**: Selects columns from the joined result (`A` and `B` joined on `BATCH_NO` and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`) where `rn = 1` to fetch only one row per `BATCH_NO` and `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` combination.

- **Ordering**: Orders the final result by `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `TRX_DATE`, and `A.BATCH_NO` as specified.

### Verification Steps:

1. **Check Join Results**: Execute the query and inspect the results to verify that `PRODUCT_QTY` and `INPUT_QTY` are correctly linked based on `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE`.

2. **Review Data Relationships**: Cross-check the relationships between `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` in subquery `A` and `INPUT_ITEM_CODE` in subquery `B` to confirm they correctly correspond to each other.

3. **Verify Parameters**: Ensure that `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` have valid values that match existing data in your `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` table.

By following these steps and ensuring all references are correctly aliased, you should be able to retrieve the desired data with the proper linkage between `PRODUCT_QTY` and `INPUT_QTY` based on your business logic. Adjust the query as per your specific database schema and requirements.
