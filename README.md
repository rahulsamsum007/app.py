If the inner queries (`A` and `B`) are returning data correctly but the full query isn't producing any results, there could be a few reasons for this issue. Let's troubleshoot step by step to ensure the full query runs correctly:

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Verify Parameters**: Ensure that the parameters `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` are correctly set and have values that match existing data in your `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` table. If these parameters are not set correctly or don't match any data, the outer query won't return any results.

2. **Check Join Condition**: Confirm that the join condition `A.PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE = B.INPUT_ITEM_CODE` is correct and effectively links the rows from subquery `A` (which calculates `PRODUCT_QTY`) with those from subquery `B` (which calculates `INPUT_QTY`). If there are no matching `INPUT_ITEM_CODE` values in `B` for `PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE` values in `A`, it could result in no rows being returned in the outer query.

3. **Ensure Data Availability**: Double-check if there are actually rows in your `XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS` table that satisfy the conditions for `LINE_TYPE`, `PROD_TYPE`, `ORGANIZATION_ID`, and `TRX_DATE` used in both subqueries (`A` and `B`). If there's no data that matches these conditions, the outer query will naturally return no results.

4. **Review Filtering Conditions**: Review the conditions `LINE_TYPE = 1` and `LINE_TYPE = -1`, along with `PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'`, to ensure they accurately filter the data as expected. If these conditions are too restrictive or not matching any data, it could lead to an empty result set.

5. **Debug with SELECT Statements**: Before running the entire query, try running the inner queries (`A` and `B`) separately with hard-coded values for `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` to verify they return expected results. This can help isolate whether the issue lies in the inner queries or in the outer query structure.

### Example of Debugging with SELECT Statements:

```sql
-- Subquery A: Check for PRODUCT_QTY
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE AS PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    SUM(TRX_QTY) AS PRODUCT_QTY
FROM
    XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE
    LINE_TYPE = 1
    AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
    AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID  -- Replace with actual value
    AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE  -- Replace with actual value
GROUP BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE;

-- Subquery B: Check for INPUT_QTY
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE AS INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    SUM(TRX_QTY) AS INPUT_QTY
FROM
    XXSRF.JUMBO_MET_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE
    LINE_TYPE = -1
    AND PROD_TYPE LIKE '%JUMBO%'
    AND ORGANIZATION_ID = :ORGANIZATION_ID  -- Replace with actual value
    AND TRX_DATE = :TRX_DATE  -- Replace with actual value
GROUP BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    ITEM_CODE;
```

Run these SELECT statements with actual values substituted for `:ORGANIZATION_ID` and `:TRX_DATE` to see if they return expected results. If they do, then the issue might lie in the outer query or its parameters.

### Final Check for Full Query:

Once you've verified that the inner queries are returning data as expected, use those verified parameters in your full query:

```sql
SELECT
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    'JUMBO' AS PROD_TYPE,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO,
    PRODUCT_ITEM_CODE,
    INPUT_ITEM_CODE,
    PRODUCT_QTY,
    INPUT_QTY
FROM (
    -- Your existing full query here
) C
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY
    ORGANIZATION_ID,
    TRX_DATE,
    BATCH_NO;
```

Ensure `rn = 1` condition in the outer query (`WHERE rn = 1`) is appropriate based on your data model and requirements. This should help you pinpoint where the issue might be occurring and ensure your query fetches the expected results.
